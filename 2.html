        <h2>Can machines think?</h2>
        <h3>Less than a decade after breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allied Forces win World War II
             mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a simple question: "Can machines think?" 
             Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and its subsequent Turing Test,
              established the fundamental goal and vision of artificial intelligence.   
              At its core, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to answer Turing's question in the affirmative. It is the endeavor
               to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines.</h3>
